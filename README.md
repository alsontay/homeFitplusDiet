## Motivation

Due to COVID-19, various movement restrictions were put in place and many people were forced to stay within their homes and only go out for necessities. In many countries, self-quarantine and the temporary closure of many businesses has hindered the steps many take to live a healthy lifestyle. Limited access to fresh and healthy food options, means that more would resort to unhealthy processed food, and the restrictions on public exercise venues such as gyms, swimming pools and exercise corners has led to many leading sedentary and unhealthy lifestyles within the confines of their homes. A poll done by AIA revealed that as a result of COVID-19, 65% of Singaporeans realise that they have been taking their health for granted. Therefore, there is a pressing need for an application to lead people towards a healthy lifestyle. It is also especially crucial as it enables us to build resistance during current circumstances.
## Overview

Our Home Fit+Diet application will provide users with daily workout plans, dieting and nutrition tips and healthy food recipes so that users can maintain a healthy lifestyle while working or schooling from home. The application will customize and create a user’s fitness and nutrition plan based on their goals. In addition to providing healthy recipes, the application can also suggest food recipes based on the user’s limited available ingredients that will meet the requirements of the plan. It is similar to combining MyFitnessPal (food tracking application, with database of recipes) and FitPlan (physical workout with trainers and athletes), but with more customizations available for users.
